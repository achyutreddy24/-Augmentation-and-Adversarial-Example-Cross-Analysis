-Change saving/loading to include epoch,state_dict,optimizer,loss
-Change a bunch of options to be in epochs instead of batches (e.g. save_interval, sample interval as in ATACGAN_MNIST_Def_New.py)
-Add checkpointing
-Make one .py for attack and one .py for defense that can take any dataset and models as parameters
